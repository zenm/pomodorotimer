#Pomodoro timer

## Background
### Who are you?
You might call yourself a freeCodeCamp student. You also might take a role as a software developer.

I worked as a Product Manager, and I also want to work as a developer.

I made this timer with HTML, CSS, JS, with help from a library, font awesome.

### What am I looking at?
You just looked at my pomodoro timer. I built this as part of the freeCodeCamp curriculum.

### What's freeCodeCamp?
freeCodeCamp is a global network of students who are teaching themselves how to code. Find out more about freeCodeCamp https://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/build-a-pomodoro-clock

### How often could I use your pomodoro timer?
Use my pomodoro timer as often as you would like.

### How do I use your timer?
When the page loads, feel free to add a goal and adjust the timer settings. Then, click the start button and get started on your task. Don't stop until your break time. You'll know you've reached the break time when the screen turns red.

### Why did you build this?
I wanted to build this as part of the freeCodeCamp curriculum. I also wanted to show that I can build software, so that I can get a job working as a developer.

### What decisions did you decide to make when building this project?
I took guidance from the curriculum's user stories.
**User Story: I can start a 25 minute pomodoro, and the timer will go off once 25 minutes has elapsed.**

**User Story: I can reset the clock for my next pomodoro.**

**User Story: I can customize the length of each pomodoro.**
